# Masterclass in Modelling and Inference

A course for the Health Data Research PhD Programme in Health Data Science.

This is a two-hour masterclass that is split into two parts:

1. **The importance of priors**. The first part of the course will briefly introduce Bayesian Statistics before we consider the role of prior distributions.

2. **Model misspecification**. The second part of the course will examine the practical implications of model misspecification.

**Prerequisites**

If you have no formal experience in Bayesian Statistics, the following primer is a useful read to get started: [Bayesian statistics and modelling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-020-00001-2)
